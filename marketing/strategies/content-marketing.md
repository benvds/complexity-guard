# Content Marketing Strategy

## Goal

Establish ComplexityGuard as the authoritative voice on TypeScript/JavaScript code complexity. Drive organic discovery through high-value technical content that developers actually want to read and share.

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: Code Complexity Education
**Audience:** Developers learning about complexity metrics
**Format:** Deep-dive technical articles
**SEO value:** High (evergreen, informational intent)

Topics:
- "What Is Cognitive Complexity? A Developer's Guide" (vs. cyclomatic)
- "Halstead Metrics Explained: When Branch Counting Isn't Enough"
- "The 5 Types of Code Complexity (and Which Ones Actually Matter)"
- "Why Your ESLint Complexity Rule Isn't Catching the Real Problems"
- "Nesting Depth: The Hidden Complexity Metric Nobody Talks About"

### Pillar 2: AI Code Quality
**Audience:** Teams using AI coding assistants
**Format:** Data-driven analysis + practical guides
**SEO value:** Very high (trending topic, commercial intent)

Topics:
- "AI-Generated Code Has 40% Higher Complexity: What That Means for Your Team"
- "The Complexity Gate for Copilot: Automated Quality Checks for AI-Assisted Development"
- "Vibe Coding Is Creating a Technical Debt Time Bomb. Here's How to Defuse It."
- "Measuring AI Code Quality: 5 Metrics That Actually Matter"
- "Before and After: Running Complexity Analysis on AI-Generated TypeScript"

### Pillar 3: Practical CI/CD Integration
**Audience:** DevOps engineers, tech leads setting up quality gates
**Format:** Step-by-step tutorials with code examples
**SEO value:** High (transactional intent)

Topics:
- "Add a Complexity Gate to Your GitHub Actions Pipeline in 5 Minutes"
- "SARIF Output: How to Get Inline Complexity Annotations on GitHub PRs"
- "Complexity Budgets: How to Set Thresholds That Don't Annoy Your Team"
- "The Baseline + Ratchet Pattern: Improving Code Quality Without Breaking Existing Code"
- "From 0 to Quality Gate: ComplexityGuard + GitLab CI Tutorial"

### Pillar 4: Case Studies & Benchmarks
**Audience:** Engineering managers evaluating tools
**Format:** Data-rich analysis of real codebases
**SEO value:** Moderate (builds authority)

Topics:
- "We Analyzed 83 Open Source TypeScript Projects. Here's What We Found."
- "The VS Code Codebase: 59,316 Functions Analyzed in 3.3 Seconds"
- "Complexity Comparison: React vs Vue vs Svelte Codebases"
- "What 'Good' Code Complexity Looks Like (Based on Real Data)"
- "How Top Open Source Projects Keep Complexity in Check"

- **Newsletters:** Submit to JavaScript Weekly, Bytes, Node Weekly, TLDR Dev

## Content Copy Examples

### Blog Post: "AI-Generated Code Has 40% Higher Complexity"

**Headline:** AI-Generated Code Has 40% Higher Complexity: What That Means for Your Team

**Subhead:** Code complexity rose by more than 40% in AI-assisted repositories. Static analysis warnings increased 30%. Here's what the data says and how to protect your codebase.

**Opening paragraph:**
Your team adopted Copilot six months ago. PRs are bigger. Features ship faster. The test suite still passes. Everything looks fine — until you measure what's actually happening to your code.

Recent research from CodeRabbit and Sonar shows a pattern that's becoming impossible to ignore: AI coding assistants produce code with systematically higher complexity. Not more bugs (yet). Not more security vulnerabilities (yet). But measurably more complex, harder-to-maintain code that accumulates silently, one merge at a time.

**CTA:** Run `complexity-guard src/` on your codebase today. The health score tells you where you stand in 3 seconds.

### Tutorial: "Add a Complexity Gate to GitHub Actions in 5 Minutes"

**Headline:** Add a Complexity Gate to Your GitHub Actions Pipeline in 5 Minutes

**Opening:**
Quality gates catch problems before they merge. Most teams have linting and tests. Few have complexity analysis. Here's how to add one to your TypeScript project in 5 minutes.

**Steps:**
1. Add complexity-guard to your workflow
2. Set your baseline health score
3. Configure thresholds for your team
4. Enable SARIF for inline PR annotations

**Closing CTA:** Want to track your health score over time? Star the repo on GitHub to stay updated on trend tracking features.
