## Note on Paid Advertising

Paid ads are low priority for ComplexityGuard's launch phase. Developer tools convert better through organic channels (HN, Reddit, dev.to, newsletters). These ad concepts are prepared for when/if paid promotion becomes relevant — likely after establishing product-market fit with free channels.

### Awareness (Cold Audience)

**Promoted Tweet 1:**
Your codebase has a complexity budget. You're probably over it.

complexity-guard src/

One command. Five metrics. A health score in 3 seconds.

**Promoted Tweet 2:**
AI coding assistants produce code with 40% higher complexity.

Your tests pass. Your linter is happy. But your codebase is silently getting harder to maintain.

ComplexityGuard catches what humans and AI both miss.

npm install -g complexity-guard

### Retargeting (Visited site/repo)

**Promoted Tweet 3:**
Still thinking about code complexity?

Here's what teams using ComplexityGuard do:
1. Set a health score baseline
2. Enforce it in CI
3. Ratchet up after each refactoring sprint

Their complexity budget never goes backwards.

### For Engineering Managers

**Headline:** Your team feels the complexity. Now prove it with data.

**Body:**
Code complexity is the invisible tax on your engineering velocity. But when tech leads ask for refactoring time, the question is always: "Where? How bad? What's the ROI?"

ComplexityGuard gives you the data:
- One health score (0-100) for your entire TypeScript/JavaScript codebase
- Ranked hotspot list showing exactly which functions to fix first
- HTML report you can share with stakeholders

Free, open-source, no setup required.

**CTA:** Try ComplexityGuard
