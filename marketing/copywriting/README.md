# Copywriting Assets

Ready-to-use copy for all marketing channels, organized by format.

## Assets

| Asset | Purpose | Audience |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [Landing Page](landing-page.md) | Website homepage / product page | All segments |
| [Social Media](social-media.md) | Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Reddit posts | Developer community |
| [Email Sequences](email-sequences.md) | Onboarding + nurture emails | New users, evaluators |
| [Blog Outlines](blog-outlines.md) | Content marketing blog posts | Technical audience |
| [Ad Copy](ad-copy.md) | Paid advertising (if applicable) | Targeted segments |

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Voice
- **Technical but accessible:** Use precise terminology but explain concepts
- **Confident but modest:** Let data speak. Avoid superlatives.
- **Practitioner perspective:** Write as someone who builds software, not someone who sells it
- **Direct:** Say what things are. Skip marketing fluff.

### Tone by Channel
| Channel | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| HN / Reddit | Understated, technical | "It measures five metrics and combines them into a score" |
| Dev.to / Blog | Educational, thorough | "Here's how cognitive complexity differs from cyclomatic..." |
| Twitter/X | Concise, data-forward | "59K functions. 3.3 seconds. One binary." |
| Email | Helpful, not salesy | "You installed ComplexityGuard. Here's what to try first." |
| Landing page | Clear, benefit-focused | "SonarQube-level analysis. Zero setup." |

### Words to Use
- analyze, measure, enforce, detect, surface, identify
- fast, focused, deterministic, actionable
- health score, quality gate, complexity budget

### Words to Avoid
- revolutionary, game-changing, cutting-edge, next-generation
- AI-powered (unless referring to the AI code quality problem)
- enterprise-grade (unless in enterprise context)
- seamless, frictionless (overused)
