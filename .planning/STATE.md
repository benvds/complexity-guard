# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Deliver accurate, fast complexity analysis in a single binary that runs locally and offline — making code health metrics accessible without SaaS dependencies or slow tooling.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Project Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 12 (Project Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD (planning not started)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-14 — Roadmap created with 12 phases covering all 72 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: None yet
- Trend: N/A

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Zig over Rust: Faster compile times, simpler C interop for tree-sitter, single static binary (Pending)
- tree-sitter for parsing: Proven grammars, error-tolerant, incremental (Pending)
- Five metric families: Covers structural, flow, cognitive, duplication, and information-theoretic dimensions (Pending)
- Weighted composite score: Single health score lets teams customize what complexity means (Pending)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 considerations:**
- Verify Zig 0.14.x std.Thread.Pool API with official documentation (research suggests API may have changed since training data)
- Confirm tree-sitter C API thread-safety guarantees for parallel parsing
- Establish cross-platform build on CI immediately (Windows path handling must work from start)

**Phase 3 considerations:**
- Tree-sitter memory management at Zig/C boundary requires careful cleanup patterns (use defer for ts_tree_delete)

**Phase 5 considerations:**
- Cognitive complexity arrow function nesting is controversial in SonarSource spec — may need configuration flag

**Phase 11 considerations:**
- Rabin-Karp hash collision rate needs empirical tuning with large TypeScript codebases
- Duplication detection may conflict with < 1s performance target on 10K files — consider opt-in flag
