<current_state>
UAT session for Phase 13 is in progress. The 13-UAT.md file has been created with 4 tests extracted from 13-01-SUMMARY.md. Test 1 was presented to the user but no response was received yet. All 4 tests are still pending.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 13 code execution: DONE (all 4 pipeline gaps wired, 8 tests added, builds clean)
- UAT file created: 13-UAT.md with 4 testable deliverables extracted from SUMMARY
- Test 1 presented to user: "Cyclomatic thresholds from config file"
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Test 1: Cyclomatic thresholds from config file — awaiting user response
- Test 2: --metrics flag gates exit codes — pending
- Test 3: --no-duplication skips duplication detection — pending
- Test 4: --save-baseline includes duplication weight — pending
- After all tests: if issues found, run diagnosis + fix planning pipeline
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Extracted 4 user-observable tests from the SUMMARY (one per gap fix)
- Skipped internal/implementation details (helper function patterns, duplication of isMetricEnabled, etc.)
- Each test focuses on CLI-level observable behavior
</decisions_made>

<context>
This is a verify-work (UAT) session for phase 13. The phase closed 4 pipeline gaps:
1. Cyclomatic config thresholds now flow from config file (CYCL-09)
2. --metrics flag now gates exit code counting (CLI-07)
3. --no-duplication flag now prevents duplication detection (CLI-08)
4. --save-baseline default config now includes duplication weight 0.20 (CFG-04)

All code changes are committed and tests pass. The UAT is purely user-facing verification.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:verify-work 13` — it will detect the existing 13-UAT.md session and resume from Test 1 (first pending test). Present the checkpoint box and wait for user response.
