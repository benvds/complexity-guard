## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. CHANGELOG format
expected: CHANGELOG.md exists at project root with Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 format, [Unreleased] section, [0.1.0] entry dated 2026-02-15 listing current features, and comparison links at bottom.
result: pass

### 2. Release script
expected: scripts/release.sh exists, is executable, and when run without arguments shows usage or defaults to "patch". It should accept bump type (major/minor/patch) as argument. Uses set -euo pipefail.
result: issue
reported: "fail, gap: script usage should be documented with examples, describe what is means to do a release and what the difference is from a publish"
severity: major

### 3. CI test workflow
expected: .github/workflows/test.yml exists. Triggers on pull requests and pushes to main. Runs tests on Ubuntu and macOS matrix. Uses mlugg/setup-zig@v2 with Zig 0.15.2. Includes release binary smoke test.
result: pass

### 4. npm package structure
expected: Root package.json exists with optionalDependencies for 5 platforms. bin/complexity-guard.js wrapper script exists with platform detection. Five platform package.json files exist under npm/ (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-arm64, linux-x64, windows-x64) each with correct os/cpu fields.
result: issue
reported: "why is this placed in the root of the directory? i'd rather have publications scoped to a folder, so: publication/npm and publication/homebrew"
severity: major

### 5. Homebrew formula
expected: homebrew/complexity-guard.rb exists with platform detection (on_macos/on_linux with CPU checks), download URL pattern, and SHA256 placeholders ready for release workflow substitution.
result: issue
reported: "gap: unclear how dese SHA256 are updated, create docs and necessary scripts"
severity: major

### 6. README progressive disclosure
expected: README.md has concise tagline, Quick Start with npm/Homebrew/direct download installation, Example Output showing console output, Features section (current features only), Documentation section linking to docs/ pages, Configuration example, and Building from Source. No mention of unimplemented features (cognitive, Halstead, SARIF, HTML, duplication).
result: pass

### 7. Getting Started guide
expected: docs/getting-started.md covers installation (npm, Homebrew, direct download, source), first analysis walkthrough, understanding output (threshold indicators, verbosity modes), and configuration (.complexityguard.json). Friendly tone throughout.
result: pass

### 8. CLI Reference
expected: docs/cli-reference.md documents all flags (help, version, init, format, output, color, verbose, quiet, metrics, threads, baseline, include, exclude, fail-on, config), exit codes table, and JSON output schema. Flag names match actual implementation.
result: pass

### 9. Examples cookbook
expected: docs/examples.md has basic usage examples, CI integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins), configuration recipes (strict, lenient, exclude tests, TypeScript only, monorepo), working with JSON output (jq examples), and shell integration (pre-commit hooks, npm scripts).
result: pass

### 10. Release workflow
expected: .github/workflows/release.yml uses workflow_dispatch with version input. Job chain: validate -> build -> release -> (npm-publish || homebrew-update). Build targets 5 platforms (x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux, x86_64-macos, aarch64-macos, x86_64-windows). Uses softprops/action-gh-release@v2.
result: issue
reported: "failed: gap whole release cycle is still unclear or too complex, also needs better documentation"
severity: major
