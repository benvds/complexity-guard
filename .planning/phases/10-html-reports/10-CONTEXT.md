# Phase 10: HTML Reports - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Generate self-contained HTML reports with interactive visualizations for stakeholders. Single HTML file with all CSS and JavaScript inlined. Reports show project health, file breakdowns, and function-level metrics. No external dependencies at runtime.

## Implementation Decisions

### Dashboard layout
- Hotspot-first design: top 5 worst functions displayed as cards with context (function name, file, all metric scores, violated thresholds)
- Health score + file breakdown shown alongside hotspots: project health score with visual distribution bar showing healthy/warning/error file proportions
- Summary stats include: total files, total functions, files with errors, files with warnings, plus distribution bar

### File/function drill-down
- Expandable rows: file list below dashboard, click to expand and see functions inline
- Collapsed file rows show: file path + health score with color indicator (minimal, scan-friendly)
- Expanded function detail: metric table with columns for each metric (cyclomatic, cognitive, Halstead volume, etc.)
- File list sortable by clicking column headers (health score, function count, worst violation)

### Visual style & branding
- Respect system color scheme preference (CSS prefers-color-scheme for auto light/dark)
- Minimal branding: small "Generated by ComplexityGuard" footer with timestamp
- Progressive density: scannable at first glance (dashboard), dense when drilling down (function tables)
- Threshold colors: muted/neutral for healthy, subtle yellow for warnings, strong red for errors — emphasis on problems, not noise
- PicoCSS-inspired: semantic HTML, class-light, clean and minimal styling

### Data visualizations
- Rich visualizations using pure CSS/SVG (no JS charting library dependency)
- Project overview: treemap (files as rectangles sized by function count, colored by health score) + bar chart (files ranked by health score)
- Function-level: inline metric bars next to each value showing proximity to threshold
- All visualizations self-contained — no external dependencies

### Responsiveness
- Fully responsive: works on both mobile and desktop
- Single self-contained HTML file with all CSS and JavaScript inlined

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact treemap/bar chart SVG implementation approach
- Sorting algorithm for interactive column headers
- Expand/collapse animation style
- Typography and spacing choices within PicoCSS-inspired aesthetic
- Dark mode color palette specifics

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "Take inspiration from PicoCSS" — minimal, semantic HTML, class-light styling, elegant defaults
- "Scannable at first glance, dense when drilling down" — progressive information density
- Single HTML file with all CSS and JS included — zero external runtime dependencies
- Muted colors for healthy state, only highlight problems — don't distract from actionable items

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
