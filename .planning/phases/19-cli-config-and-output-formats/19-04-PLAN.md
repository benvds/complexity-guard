<objective>
Add lightweight documentation notes about the Rust rewrite to existing docs.

Purpose: CLAUDE.md mandates doc updates for user-facing changes. Phase 19 adds the full CLI and output format pipeline in Rust. Since the Rust binary is not yet the shipped product (that happens in Phase 22), these are minimal notes — not a full rewrite of all docs. Just enough to acknowledge the Rust rewrite is in progress and that build/CLI instructions will apply to both binaries.
Output: Small additions to 4 existing doc files.

Add a short "Rust Rewrite (In Progress)" section or note to each file. Do NOT rewrite existing Zig documentation — just append a note.

**README.md**: Add a section after the existing build instructions:
```markdown
## Rust Rewrite (In Progress)

A Rust rewrite is underway targeting 1:1 feature parity with the Zig binary. The Rust binary accepts the same CLI flags and produces identical output formats. To build from the Rust source:

\`\`\`sh
cd rust && cargo build --release
\`\`\`

The Rust binary will replace the Zig binary in a future release. Until then, the Zig binary remains the official distribution.
```

**docs/cli-reference.md**: Add a note at the top:
```markdown
> **Note:** The Rust rewrite (in progress) accepts the same CLI flags documented here. No changes to the CLI interface.
```

**docs/getting-started.md**: Add a note about Rust build as an alternative:
```markdown
> **Note:** A Rust rewrite is in progress. To build from Rust source: `cd rust && cargo build --release`. The CLI interface is identical.
```

**docs/examples.md**: Add a note:
```markdown
> **Note:** All examples below work identically with the Rust binary (in progress). Output formats are the same.
```

Do NOT update publication/npm/README.md or publication/npm/packages/*/README.md yet — those are updated when the Rust binary ships (Phase 22).

<verification>
1. `grep -c "Rust" README.md docs/cli-reference.md docs/getting-started.md docs/examples.md` — each file has at least 1 match
2. Existing Zig build instructions and CLI docs are unchanged
3. No publication/npm README files were modified
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README.md, docs/cli-reference.md, docs/getting-started.md, docs/examples.md each have a Rust rewrite note
- Existing documentation content is preserved
- Publication READMEs are not touched (deferred to Phase 22)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/19-cli-config-and-output-formats/19-04-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
