# Phase 05.1 Plan 03: User Documentation Summary

Progressive disclosure README and comprehensive docs/ pages for current features.

## One-Liner

Complete user documentation with TanStack-style progressive disclosure README, getting started guide, CLI reference, and examples cookbook covering cyclomatic complexity and console/JSON output.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Rewrite README with Progressive Disclosure

**Commit:** `5b9a0a0`

Rewrote README.md following TanStack-style progressive disclosure pattern:
- Concise tagline: "Fast complexity analysis for TypeScript/JavaScript — single static binary, zero dependencies"
- Quick Start section with npm, Homebrew, and direct download installation
- Example Output showing realistic console output with threshold indicators
- Features section highlighting current capabilities (cyclomatic, console/JSON, configurable thresholds, zero config, single binary, error-tolerant parsing)
- Documentation section with links to all three docs/ pages
- Configuration section with example .complexityguard.json
- Building from Source section with Zig commands
- License section

Removed all references to unimplemented features (cognitive, Halstead, structural, duplication, composite, SARIF, HTML). Removed Status/Completed/Up Next sections (belong in .planning/). Removed Architecture and Project Structure (belong in CLAUDE.md).

### Task 2: Create Comprehensive docs/ Pages

**Commit:** `16ec4c6`

Created three documentation pages with friendly, thorough tone:

**docs/getting-started.md** (7.0K):
- Installation section covering npm, Homebrew, direct download, and building from source
- First Analysis walkthrough
- Understanding the Output section explaining threshold indicators, function info, default thresholds, and verbosity modes
- Configuration section with .complexityguard.json walkthrough, file patterns, threshold customization, and counting rules
- Next Steps links to CLI Reference and Examples

**docs/cli-reference.md** (12K):
- Complete CLI usage and arguments documentation
- All flags documented: general (help, version, init), output (format, output, color, verbose, quiet), analysis (metrics, threads, baseline), file filtering (include, exclude), thresholds (fail-on), configuration (config)
- Full .complexityguard.json schema with all options
- Exit codes table with priority order explanation
- JSON output schema with complete field documentation
- All flags match actual implementation in src/cli/args.zig and src/cli/help.zig
- Exit codes match implementation in src/output/exit_codes.zig

**docs/examples.md** (11K):
- Basic usage examples (analyze directory, specific files, verbose, save to file)
- CI integration section with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins examples
- Configuration recipes: strict mode, lenient mode, exclude tests, TypeScript only, monorepo, classic McCabe, ESLint-aligned
- Working with JSON output: extract summary, find high-complexity functions, filter by status, per-file analysis, generate CSV, compare baseline, custom scripts
- Shell integration: pre-commit hooks, npm scripts, make targets

All content reflects current features only. No "coming soon" or references to unimplemented features except where explicitly marked as "reserved for future use" in CLI reference JSON schema documentation.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Key Decisions

1. **Progressive disclosure README structure** — Provides quick start path without overwhelming users. README gives overview, docs/ pages provide depth.
2. **Zero mentions of unimplemented features** — Prevents confusion and sets accurate expectations. Users know exactly what works today.
3. **Friendly and thorough tone throughout** — Follows user decision from CONTEXT. Makes documentation approachable and reduces support burden.

## Verification

- [x] README links to all three docs/ pages (getting-started.md, cli-reference.md, examples.md)
- [x] All links resolve correctly
- [x] No mention of cognitive, Halstead, structural, duplication, composite metrics as current features
- [x] No mention of SARIF or HTML output formats as current capabilities
- [x] All flag names match actual implementation in src/cli/args.zig
- [x] All exit codes match implementation in src/output/exit_codes.zig
- [x] Tone is friendly and thorough throughout with prose and code examples

## Self-Check

### Files Created

```
✓ README.md (rewritten)
✓ docs/getting-started.md
✓ docs/cli-reference.md
✓ docs/examples.md
```

### Commits Exist

```
✓ 5b9a0a0: docs(05.1-03): rewrite README with progressive disclosure
✓ 16ec4c6: docs(05.1-03): create comprehensive documentation pages
```

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files created and all commits exist.

## Impact

**User experience:**
- Clear quick start path for new users via progressive disclosure
- Comprehensive reference documentation for all current features
- Real-world examples for CI integration and configuration
- Friendly, approachable tone reduces barrier to adoption

**Documentation quality:**
- Accurate representation of current capabilities (no feature creep in docs)
- TanStack-style progressive disclosure improves information architecture
- Comprehensive CLI reference makes tool self-documenting
- CI integration examples accelerate production deployment

**Future-proofing:**
- JSON schema documented with null fields for future metrics
- CLI flags marked as "reserved for future use" where applicable
- Config schema extensible (counting_rules, thresholds per metric)

## Next Steps

Users now have complete documentation for:
- Installing and running ComplexityGuard
- Understanding console and JSON output
- Configuring thresholds and counting rules
- Integrating with CI/CD pipelines
- Working with JSON output programmatically

Documentation is ready for:
- Phase 05.1 Plan 04: npm and Homebrew publishing
- External users trying the tool
- Community contributions
